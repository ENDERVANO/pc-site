## A bit of a story behind this project

I spent a looooong time working on this â€” with plenty of breaks, late nights, and serious grinding.  
It wasnâ€™t easy and sometimes I really had to push myself hard, but I learned *a lot* along the way.  
Every pixel, every line of code was crafted with care and patience.  

So yeah, it may look simple on the outside, but this project is packed with sweat and dedication.
